      Returns an error when the trash can not be accessed. Often this occurs
      because the access token is invalid or has expired, or because the trash
      hit a scale limit for the user.

      * `dataset_too_large_for_offset_based_paging`: Returned when the number
        of items in the trash has exceeded the number that can be returned with
        simple offset-based pagination (100,000). When this happens, the API
        will need to switch to marker-based pagination to access the trash for
        this user.
